    <h2>About me:</h2>

    <h3>I am a originally a back-end developer, but why i am giving a chance to front end?</h3>
    <p>Well, i aways thought that front-end was terrible to learn and borring,
        but when i tried for the first time really learn <br />
        i feel really great, more than when i started with back-end, more especifically, with C# programming. So, i'm having <br />
        so much fun learning new things!
    </p>
    <h3>Do i have some experience in TI area?</h3>
    <p>Well, yes, but no. This can be a little confusing, but the answer is not easy to answer, not for
        me. I never had a job as <br /> back-end developer or with AI, which is my prime area. Instead, i worked in some solo projects and college projects too <br />
        what make me feel really confortable to get some "hard" challenges in area. So... maybe the answear that you are searching for is NO.
